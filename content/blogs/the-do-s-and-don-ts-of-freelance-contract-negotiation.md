# The Do's and Don'ts of Freelance Contract Negotiation

As a freelancer, you are in a unique position when it comes to negotiating your contracts. You are your own boss, which means that you have the final say in what you agree to and what you don't. However, this also means that you are at a disadvantage when it comes to negotiating your contracts, because you don't have the backing of a company.

That being said, there are certain do's and don'ts that you should keep in mind when you are negotiating your freelance contracts.

## Do:

1. **Do your research**

   Before you start negotiating your contract, it is important that you do your research. This means that you should know what the going rate is for the work you will be doing. You can use sites like Glassdoor and Payscale to get an idea of what others in your field are making.

2. **Do be prepared to walk away**

   If you are not happy with the terms of the contract, be prepared to walk away. This doesn't mean that you should be rude or unprofessional, but it does mean that you should be firm in your convictions. Remember, you are the one in control of the situation, so don't be afraid to use that to your advantage.

3. **Do ask for what you want**

   When you are negotiating your contract, it is important that you ask for what you want. If you don't ask for what you want, you will never get it. So, if you want more money, more vacation days, or a flexible schedule, be sure to ask for it.

## Don't:

1. **Don't be afraid to ask for help**

   If you are not sure how to negotiate your contract, don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many resources available to help you, including books, articles, and even online courses.

2. **Don't take the first offer**

   When you are negotiating your contract, it is important to remember that the first offer is usually not the best offer. So, don't be afraid to counter-offer or even walk away from the deal if you don't feel like you are getting what you deserve.

3. **Don't be afraid to be assertive**

   When you are negotiating your contract, it is important to be assertive. This doesn't mean that you should be rude or aggressive, but it does mean that you should be firm in your convictions. Remember, you are the one in control of the situation, so don't be afraid to use that to your advantage.

In conclusion, there are many things to keep in mind when you are negotiating your freelance contracts. However, the most important thing to remember is that you are in control of the situation. So, be prepared, be assertive, and be willing to walk away if you don't feel like you are getting what you deserve.
