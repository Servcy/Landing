    Investing in yourself will not only make you more knowledgeable and skilled, but it will also make you more marketable. And, when you are more marketable, you can charge more for your services.

2. **Do: Stay Organized**

    When you are your own boss, it is easy to let things slide. But, if you want to be successful, you need to stay organized. That means keeping track of your deadlines, your invoices, and your client communications.

    There are a lot of great tools available to help you stay organized. And, if you can stay organized, you will be able to better manage your time and your workload.

    It is easy to get caught up in the day-to-day grind of freelancing. But, if you want to be successful, you need to set goals. What do you want to accomplish in the next month? The next year? The next five years?

    Setting goals will help you stay focused and motivated. And, when you achieve your goals, you will be able to look back on your career with a sense of pride and accomplishment.

9. **Do: Believe in Yourself**

    One of the most important things you can do as a freelancer is to believe in yourself. When you believe in yourself, you will be able to overcome any obstacle. And, when you are confident in your abilities, you will be more likely to land new clients and close deals.
