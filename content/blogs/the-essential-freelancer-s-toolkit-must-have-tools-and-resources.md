As a freelancer, you likely wear a lot of hats and have to juggle a lot of different projects at once. That's why having a good project management tool is essential. A project management tool will help you keep track of all your tasks, deadlines, and progress so you can stay on top of everything.

There are a lot of great invoicing tools out there, but our favorites are FreshBooks and Wave. Both of these tools are easy to use and have a lot of great features, like the ability to accept online payments and create recurring invoices.

### Time Tracking Software

If you want to be a successful freelancer, you need to be able to track your time accurately. Time tracking software can help you do just that. This software allows you to track how much time you're spending on each project, so you can make sure you're billing your clients accurately.
