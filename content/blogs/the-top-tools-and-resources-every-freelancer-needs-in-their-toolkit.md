# The Top Tools and Resources Every Freelancer Needs in Their Toolkit

When it comes to being a freelancer, there are a lot of things you need to be aware of. Not only do you need to be up to date with the latest trends and technologies, but you also need to have a solid understanding of the business side of things.

That's why we've put together a list of the top tools and resources every freelancer needs in their toolkit. With these at your disposal, you'll be able to work smarter, not harder, and ultimately land more clients and projects.

The first thing you need in your toolkit is a strong understanding of SEO. This will help you ensure that your website and online portfolio are visible to potential clients who are searching for your skills and services.

There are a number of resources you can use to brush up on your SEO knowledge, but our favourites are Moz's Beginner's Guide to SEO and Search Engine Land's Guide to SEO.

Once you've got your SEO sorted, it's time to start thinking about copywriting. After all, the words you use on your website and in your proposals will play a big role in whether or not a potential client decides to work with you.

To help you write copy that converts, we recommend checking out Copyblogger's guide to writing persuasive web copy and HubSpot's guide to writing for the web.

When it comes to proposals, there's no one-size-fits-all approach. However, there are a few key elements that every proposal should include if you want to increase your chances of landing the project.

To learn more about what should be included in your proposals, we recommend reading this guide from The Balance Small Business.

Once you've got the basics down, it's time to start thinking about how you can stand out from the competition. After all, there are a lot of freelancers out there vying for the same clients and projects.

One way to make sure you stand out is to have an amazing portfolio. This is where you can showcase your best work and demonstrate the results you've been able to achieve for your clients.

If you're not sure where to start, we recommend checking out this guide from Smashing Magazine.

Another way to make sure you stand out is to offer something unique that your competitors don't. This could be a unique service, a guarantee, or something else that sets you apart.

To learn more about how to find your unique selling proposition, we recommend reading this guide from Entrepreneur.

Finally, it's important to always be learning and growing as a freelancer. This means keeping up with the latest trends, technologies, and best practices.

One great way to do this is to sign up for a newsletter like Freelance Folder. This will deliver the latest freelancing news and tips straight to your inbox so you can stay on top of the latest trends.

Another great way to learn and grow as a freelancer is to join a community or group. This could be an online group like Freelance Switch or a local group like a meetup.

Being a part of a community will give you access to like-minded individuals who can offer support, advice, and feedback.

In conclusion, these are just a few of the many tools and resources every freelancer needs in their toolkit. With these at your disposal, you'll be able to work smarter, not harder, and ultimately land more clients and projects.
